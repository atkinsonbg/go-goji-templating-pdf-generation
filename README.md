# Go Goji Templating/PDF Generation
This repo is used to experiment with Go's templating engine and use it to generate PDFs. One of the goals is to get a fully accessible PDF, in the least amount of time and memory/CPU footprint. The tools used are Go's text/template package, WKHTMLTOPDF, and Ghostscript.
